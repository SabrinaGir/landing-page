-issues: making website too small makes items go out of their boxes

Project Title: Landing Page (for Pica Pizza)


** Project Description **

Create a webpage using HTML and CSS. While I used the image provided by the Odin Project as a base, I also tried to customize it a bit for style reasons. 


** Overview **

This was fun to make and nice to look at on most browsers, but is not responsive to smaller browsers and phones. I'm happy with how it turned out. One thing I would change is the amount of divs used. Next time I'd prefer to use section tags instead, and use divs only for styling purposes to make my HTML better.
